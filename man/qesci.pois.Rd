\title{Calculating confidence interval for modified Poisson regression based on the quasi-score test}
\usage{
qesci.pois(formula, data, x.name=NULL, eform=FALSE, cl=0.95, C0=10^-5, digits=4)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.}

\item{data}{A data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model.}

\item{x.name}{The variable name that the confidence interval is calculated for the regression coefficient; should be involved in \code{formula} as an explanatory variable. Specify as a character object.}

\item{eform}{A logical value that specify whether the outcome should be transformed by exponential function (default: \code{FALSE})}

\item{cl}{Confidence level for calculating confidence intervals (default: 0.95)}

\item{C0}{A tuning parameter to control the precisions of numerical computations of confidence limits (default: 10^-5).}

\item{digits}{Number of decimal places in the output (default: 4).}
}
\value{
Results of the modified Poisson analyses are presented. Three objects are provided: Results of the modified Poisson regression with the Wald-type approximation by \code{rqlm}, quasi-score confidence interval for the corresponding covariate, and P-value for the quasi-score test of \code{RR=1}.
}
\description{
Recent studies revealed the risk ratio estimates and robust standard error estimates of the modified Poisson regression analysis are generally biased under small or moderate sample settings. To adjust the bias and to provide more accurate confidence intervals, confidence interval and P-value of the test for risk ratio by modified Poisson regression are calculated based on the quasi-score test of Noma et al. (2024).}
